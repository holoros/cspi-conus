# Beyond site index: FIA's own classification system disagrees with site index but agrees with a multi-dimensional composite of forest productivity at 30 m across the conterminous United States

Draft v0.10j, 15 June 2026. Builds on v0.10i by adding the explicit ESI v9 (climate + parent material) refit, the LAT/LON exclusion methodological convention, the plot-level spatial diagnostic (Figure 12) that confirms parent material acts as a cross-sectional stratification axis rather than as a residual predictive signal at the macroscale for ESI (mean |ΔESI| = 0.22 m on a 28 m scale), the BGI and Asym v9 refits (Table S13: PM contributes ΔR² = +0.001 for BGI, +0.006 for Asym, consistent with the ecological reading that deep substrate matters most for carrying capacity), and the PM-aware composite weighting analysis (Table 8: per-PM optimal weights are BGI-dominated on Alluvial and Residuum, ESI-dominated on Colluvium and Glacial, balanced on Marine, but adding pm_factor to the global composite produces no operational gain). Stand-age sign flip remains in supplementary (Table S12). The composite is ESI + BGI + Asym (3 measures) with equal-weight z-score averaging; NPP and FIA SICOND are external comparators. The strongest empirical finding remains FIA's site class (SITECLCD) correlating with biomass growth and the multi-dimensional composite, not with site index alone (random forest predicting SITECLCD: BGI alone OOB R² = 0.808 vs ESI alone 0.751). The pooled raw SICOND × ESI correlation of −0.08 is a base-age Simpson's paradox; after standardization to base 50, SICOND correlates with both ESI and BGI at r ≈ 0.45 to 0.48.

## Abstract

Forest site productivity is operationally measured in the United States by site index, the expected height of dominant trees at a reference age. We test empirically whether this single-metric view captures what productivity studies need. At 66,433 FIA Phase 2 plots where all four productivity measures are jointly available (site index, biomass growth increment, asymptotic biomass, and net primary production), and at 114,587 plots after joining FIA COND-level context (SITECLCD, STDAGE, DSTRBCD1, TRTCD1, FORTYPCD), we find that no single measure can substitute for any other: the most recoverable measure (asymptotic biomass) reaches OOB R² = 0.89 when predicted from the other three via random forest; site index itself reaches only R² = 0.70. The site-index-to-others relationship is much weaker under linear models that mirror the traditional growth-and-yield treatment (R² = 0.24).

The structure depends strongly on species, ecological regime, and geologic parent material. The ESI–BGI correlation ranges from −0.02 in loblolly pine to +0.53 in Douglas-fir stands. The Asym–NPP correlation flips sign between eastern hardwood (r = −0.60) and western conifer (r = +0.57) regimes. Geologic parent material produces an analogous sign-flip: volcanic soils have the highest mean site index in the dataset (39.9 m) yet the lowest FIA SITECLCD productivity rating (5.69 of 7), and organic soils have the lowest mean site index (19.2 m) yet a high biomass growth rate (2.04 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). The same opposite-sign disagreement between site index and FIA's classification appears in three independent stratifications.

The strongest empirical case for the multi-dimensional view comes from FIA's own productivity classification (SITECLCD): site index (ESI) mean is 30.6 m at the most productive class and 29.6 m at the least productive class, essentially flat. Biomass growth increment, in contrast, drops from 2.11 to 0.92 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ across the same classes, and a three-component composite (ESI + BGI + Asym) drops from 40.0 to 30.2 on a 0–100 scale. A random forest predicting SITECLCD from BGI alone reaches OOB R² = 0.808; from ESI alone, only 0.751. FIA-computed site index (SICOND) does correlate strongly with biomass growth (r = +0.74 in the pooled raw data), but this correlation is partly an artifact of pooling across FIA's per-region SIBASE strata. After base-age standardization to 50 yr via anamorphic Chapman-Richards projection, SICOND correlates with both biomass growth and our unified-target ESI at moderate magnitudes (r = +0.45 and +0.48 respectively); within the SIBASE = 80 and 100 strata, SICOND tracks ESI much more strongly than BGI (r = +0.80 to +0.83 with ESI). The single-metric view's structural limits are robust to this correction.

We release a three-component Composite Site Productivity Index (CSPI v2) at 30 m as one operationalization of the multi-dimensional view, with NPP and SICOND as external validation comparators. The four component layers and the composite are deposited under Zenodo concept DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20515034 (version 2.0.0 at 10.5281/zenodo.20663652).

## 1. Introduction

Forest site productivity has been measured in the United States, and operationalized in growth-and-yield models, predominantly through site index. Site index expresses height growth potential as the expected dominant tree height at a reference age, and it has anchored stand-table projection and yield estimation since the early twentieth century (Skovsgaard and Vanclay 2008). The dominance of this single metric has not been without consequence. The biometrics literature has, for several decades, recognized that site index works well within a narrow envelope (single-species pure stands, calibrated species ranges, even-aged structure) and degrades as a general productivity descriptor when those conditions are not met (Skovsgaard and Vanclay 2008, Bontemps and Bouriaud 2014). The recommendation in the conceptual literature has been to treat productivity as a multi-dimensional construct in which height growth, biomass accumulation, long-run carrying capacity, and carbon flux all carry distinct and partially independent information about the same physical site.

The operational adoption of that recommendation has been slow. One barrier is data availability: until recently, four-dimensional measurement of productivity at the conterminous United States scale required combining four independently produced surfaces that did not share a common plot set or methodology. Another barrier has been the absence of an empirical test against FIA's own productivity infrastructure: even when continuous gridded productivity surfaces exist, the question of how they relate to the FIA site index (SICOND), FIA's site class (SITECLCD), and stand context (age, forest type, disturbance history) at the plot level has not been answered at the CONUS scale.

This paper supplies that test. We compute four productivity measures at 66,433 FIA Phase 2 plots where all four are available, expand the working table to 114,587 plots by joining FIA's own COND-level context (site class, stand age, forest type group, disturbance and treatment history), and ask:

1. **Cross-substitutability**: how recoverable is each measure from the others?
2. **Traditional methods**: how much of the multi-dimensional information is captured by a linear use of site index alone, as in traditional growth-and-yield models?
3. **Stand-age dependence**: does the relationship among measures depend on stand age?
4. **Forest type and regime**: do eastern hardwood and western conifer regimes show the same productivity-measure structure?
5. **FIA agreement**: does FIA's own site class (SITECLCD) and FIA's own site index (SICOND) agree with any single measure, or with the multi-dimensional composite?

The fifth question is the headline. SITECLCD is FIA's seven-class productivity rating based on potential annual cubic-foot growth; SICOND is the FIA-computed site index using region-specific equations. Both are operational classifications used in U.S. forest assessment. If one of them disagrees with site index but agrees with biomass growth, that is empirical evidence that the field's traditional measure does not capture what the field's traditional classification system is measuring.

The companion BGI and Asym layers used here were developed in the asym_agb_analysis pipeline and are reported separately. The previous CSPI v3 and v4 release (Weiskittel 2026, Zenodo v1.0.0, 10.5281/zenodo.20515035) used FIA SICOND as the response variable for height-growth modeling. In this work we use the unified North America height-and-age compilation as the response, which removes the regional equation artifact that SICOND inherits and lets us compare two distinct site-index measures (the FIA SICOND value and the unified-target ESI prediction). The release accompanying this paper (CSPI v2.0.0, 10.5281/zenodo.20663652) ships the lightweight 1 km surface plus MOD17 mean and CV; the 30 m wall-to-wall composite and component layers will follow in v2.1.0 after Zenodo storage quota expansion.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Productivity measures

Five operational productivity measures enter the analysis. Three are internal components of the proposed composite; two are external comparators.

**Site index (ESI)** is the unified-target plot-level site index from the North America height-and-age compilation (Weiskittel et al., in preparation), in meters at base age 50. Predicted at the 30 m grid as Environmental Site Index v7 (random forest on 16 covariates).

**Biomass growth increment (BGI)** is the per-pixel annual aboveground biomass accumulation in Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, from FIA remeasurement pairs trained in the asym_agb_analysis line at 30 m (EPSG:5070).

**Asymptotic biomass (Asym)** is the per-pixel long-run carrying capacity in Mg ha⁻¹, from a Chapman-Richards asymptotic biomass fit to FIA AGB at the same plot set (30 m, EPSG:5070).

**Net primary production (NPP, external)** is the per-pixel annual carbon assimilation. We use the MODIS MOD17A3HGF 2017–2023 mean at 500 m as an external comparator; for the surface generation we use a Miami climatology layer at 1 km as the operational NPP layer.

**FIA SICOND (external)** is the FIA condition-level site index computed under per-region, per-species site index equations from the FIA COND table, joined at the plot level via PLT_CN.

### 2.2 The 3-component composite

The Composite Site Productivity Index (CSPI v2) is the z-score average of three internal components: ESI, BGI, Asym. Each component is standardized at the plot level using fixed mean and standard deviation parameters (ESI 27.81 m, SD 11.41; BGI 1.72 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, SD 0.58; Asym 249.1 Mg ha⁻¹, SD 20.3) that were locked at the v0.9 cycle's 40,933-plot four-component complete-case subset for cross-version numerical stability. The expanded 66,433-plot four-measure set and the 114,587-plot FIA-joined set used in the §3 analyses give the same z-score parameters to two decimal places, so locking does not materially affect the reported correlations. Standardized components are sigma-clipped at ±3, averaged with weights, and rescaled to 0–100 using the empirical surface-level minimum and maximum. Three weighting schemes are reported:

- **Equal weight (default)**: w = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)
- **PCA-derived weight**: weights from the first principal component of the three z-scored components (PC1 captures 56% of the variance; loadings are reported in Results)
- **Inverse-variance weight**: w_i = (1/SD_i) / Σ(1/SD_j), downweighting measures with widest dispersion

NPP and SICOND do not enter the composite; they are external validators against which the composite is compared.

### 2.3 FIA context joins

We join the 66,433-plot four-measure table to the FIA COND table by PLT_CN and approximate LAT/LON match. After the join, 114,587 plot-condition rows have at least one FIA COND field populated. The joined columns are SICOND (in ft, converted to m as SICOND × 0.3048), SIBASE, SISP (species used for SICOND), STDAGE (stand age), STDSZCD (stand size class), FORTYPCD (forest type code), SITECLCD (FIA site class 1–7), DSTRBCD1 (disturbance code), DSTRBYR1 (disturbance year), TRTCD1 (treatment code). Dominant condition per plot is retained. Subset n varies by analysis depending on FIA field completeness (e.g., SITECLCD-complete n = 63,310; STDAGE-complete n = 63,098).

### 2.4 ESI training stack

The ESI height-growth component is trained as a random forest (ranger 0.16.0; Wright and Ziegler 2017) on the unified North America site index compilation at the FIA subset (66,428 plots). Three nested versions are reported. ESI v5 uses 11 soil + terrain + canopy covariates. ESI v6 adds 19 ClimateNA covariates at 1 km. ESI v7 uses the v5 stack plus four microclimate proxies (heat load index, northness, eastness, elevation squared) and a v6 distillation column. A v8 sensitivity test adds five Sentinel-2 indices and four MOD17 terms. v7 is the recommended ESI for the composite; the v5/v6/v8 comparison is described in §3.7.

### 2.5 Multi-dimensional analyses

A1–A5 analyses (cross-prediction, per-species correlations, quartile disagreement, East–West partitioning, linear vs RF ESI recoverability) are reported in Results §3.1–§3.4. B1–B4 analyses (SICOND comparator, 3-component composite alternatives, stand-context analyses including SITECLCD, forest type group, stand age, and disturbance) are reported in §3.5–§3.8.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 No measure substitutes for another

Cross-prediction random forests predict each productivity measure from the other three. Out-of-bag R² ranges from 0.70 (site index, the LEAST recoverable) to 0.89 (asymptotic biomass, the most). Site index is the most distinct of the four measures.

**Table 1.** Cross-prediction OOB R² at 66,433 plots. Each column is the target; predictors are the other three measures.

| Target | OOB R² | OOB RMSE | Response SD | Explained SD (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Site index (ESI) | 0.704 | 5.87 m | 10.80 m | 45.6 |
| Biomass growth (BGI) | 0.821 | 0.23 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ | 0.53 | 57.7 |
| Asymptotic biomass | 0.887 | 6.79 Mg ha⁻¹ | 20.18 | 66.4 |
| NPP | 0.800 | 72.27 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹ | 161.74 | 55.3 |

### 3.2 The site-index-from-others gap between linear and nonlinear models

Linear OLS recovers only R² = 0.241 of site index variation from BGI + Asym + NPP. Random forest recovers R² = 0.704. The 0.46 gap is the cost of the traditional linear treatment: a model that uses site index as a single linear covariate captures only 24% of the multi-dimensional information that the four measures collectively carry.

### 3.3 Per-species correlations span a factor of 17

The pooled ESI–BGI correlation is r = −0.45, but this pooled value masks species-specific heterogeneity. The ESI–BGI correlation by major species:

| Species | n | ESI–BGI |
|---|---|---|
| Yellow-poplar (*Liriodendron tulipifera*) | 3,815 | 0.028 |
| White oak (*Quercus alba*) | 4,166 | 0.238 |
| Loblolly pine (*Pinus taeda*) | 16,662 | 0.145 |
| Ponderosa pine (*Pinus ponderosa*) | 4,222 | 0.295 |
| Northern red oak (*Quercus rubra*) | 2,438 | 0.217 |
| Douglas-fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*) | 2,595 | 0.492 |

The Asym–NPP correlation flips sign across species: yellow-poplar (r = −0.78), white oak (−0.72), and northern red oak (−0.58) show strong negative correlations; ponderosa pine (+0.65) and Douglas-fir (+0.52) show strong positive. The species-specific patterns cannot be flattened to a national ranking.

### 3.4 East vs West sign flip

Split at longitude −100°: East r(Asym, NPP) = −0.60; West r(Asym, NPP) = +0.57. The ESI–BGI relationship is r = 0.22 in East, 0.37 in West. The four-measure productivity construct has different internal structure in different ecological regimes.

### 3.5 SICOND and ESI measure different things

The five-measure correlation matrix at the 66,433-plot four-measure complete-case set, including FIA SICOND as an external comparator (SICOND values from the FIA COND join, available on the 64,718 plots where SICOND > 0):

**Table 2.** Pairwise Pearson r among five productivity measures.

|       | ESI    | BGI    | Asym   | NPP    | SICOND |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| ESI   | 1.000  | −0.450 | −0.027 | 0.219  | **−0.078** |
| BGI   |        | 1.000  | −0.123 | −0.279 | **+0.739** |
| Asym  |        |        | 1.000  | 0.223  | −0.178 |
| NPP   |        |        |        | 1.000  | −0.161 |
| SICOND |       |        |        |        | 1.000  |

The pooled SICOND row in Table 2 is informative but requires care to interpret because FIA SICOND inherits per-region SIBASE heterogeneity. The pooled FIA-computed site index correlates with BGI at r = **+0.739**, with our unified-target ESI at r = **−0.078**, with Asym at r = −0.18, and with NPP at r = −0.16. The −0.08 SICOND–ESI correlation appears to support strong orthogonality, but stratifying by SIBASE reveals a Simpson's paradox (Table 2a). Within the SIBASE = 50 stratum (n = 30,026), SICOND × ESI = +0.418 and SICOND × BGI = +0.473. In the SIBASE = 80 stratum (n = 3,674, predominantly Western FIA regions), SICOND × ESI = +0.797 vs SICOND × BGI = +0.211 — SICOND tracks ESI roughly four times more strongly than BGI. In the SIBASE = 100 stratum (n = 1,094), SICOND × ESI = +0.831. After anamorphic Chapman-Richards projection to a common base age of 50 yr (Carmean-style k = 0.025), the pooled SICOND × ESI correlation rises to +0.482 and SICOND × BGI drops to +0.447. The two corrected correlations are within sampling error of each other.

**Table 2a.** SICOND correlations stratified by SIBASE and after anamorphic projection to base age 50. Bracketed values are bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (1000 reps).

| Stratum | n | r(SICOND, ESI) [95% CI] | r(SICOND, BGI) [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|
| SIBASE = 50 only | 30,026 | +0.418 [0.403, 0.434] | +0.473 [0.461, 0.484] |
| SIBASE = 80 only | 3,674 | **+0.797** | +0.211 |
| SIBASE = 100 only | 1,094 | **+0.831** | +0.250 |
| Pooled, projected to base 50 | 34,794 | +0.482 [0.468, 0.495] | +0.447 [0.436, 0.457] |
| Pooled, raw (Table 2) | 43,964 | −0.078 [−0.089, −0.068] | +0.739 [0.734, 0.744] |

The 95% CIs on the pooled-projected SICOND × ESI (0.468 to 0.495) and SICOND × BGI (0.436 to 0.457) overlap, so the two corrected correlations are within sampling error of each other on this sample. The CI on the raw r = −0.078 SICOND × ESI (−0.089 to −0.068) is tight and excludes positive values, so the pooled negative correlation is statistically robust as a pooled statistic; the Simpson paradox is the explanation for why a tight negative pooled correlation coexists with strong positive within-stratum correlations.

The corrected reading is that FIA SICOND, properly understood, carries information about both the height-growth-potential dimension (correlation with ESI) and the biomass-growth dimension (correlation with BGI) at roughly equal magnitudes (r ≈ 0.45 to 0.48 after base-age correction). The raw r = +0.74 with BGI in Table 2 is partly real and partly an artifact of pooling across SIBASE strata. The earlier reading that SICOND has been "carrying biomass-growth structure for decades while labeled as a height-growth measure" overstates the case for SICOND specifically.

A second, independent traditional site index measurement supports the broader pattern. The NRCS SSURGO `coforprod` table contains site index values for forest soil components derived from soil survey interpretations independently from FIA. Joining SSURGO SI to the 87,404 FIA plots where the SSURGO mukey carries a coforprod entry (Table 2b) yields the same structural pattern: SSURGO SI correlates with BGI at r = +0.629 and with the unified-target ESI at r = −0.195. SSURGO SI also tracks raw FIA SICOND at r = +0.640, consistent with the two measurement chains sharing lookup-table lineage. The result is robust to which traditional SI measurement chain is used as the comparator: when site index is derived from operational lookup tables (whether FIA SICOND or NRCS SSURGO), the resulting values correlate more strongly with biomass growth than with a unified-target height-growth-potential SI. This is the version of the v0.9 claim that survives the v0.10b SICOND base-age correction: the traditional measurement chains share structure with biomass growth, but the structure is moderate and shared across measurements rather than uniquely diagnostic of any one chain.

**Table 2b.** NRCS SSURGO forest site index correlations with productivity measures at 87,404 FIA plots where mukey extraction returns a coforprod-eligible soil component.

| Measure | r(SSURGO_SI, .) |
|---|---|
| BGI | **+0.629** |
| SICOND_raw (FIA) | **+0.640** |
| CSPI 3-comp | +0.194 |
| NPP | +0.138 |
| ESI (unified-target) | −0.195 |
| Asym | −0.205 |

A third comparator strengthens the corrected reading further. We refit a methodologically clean site index from the unified North America compilation using a Cieszewski-Bailey base-age-invariant Chapman-Richards GADA form (Cieszewski 2002, For. Sci. 48: 7–23) on 590,212 height-age tree records aggregated to 107,885 unique FIA plot keys, with per-species anamorphic parameters fit by nonlinear least squares on the top 12 species (Table S6 in supplements). At the 16,032 plots where the GADA SI, all four productivity measures, and FIA SICOND are jointly observable, the pairwise SI correlations are tightly clustered (Table 2c): GADA SI tracks ESI v7 at **r = +0.661**, the strongest pairing among the three SI measures. GADA SI tracks raw FIA SICOND at r = +0.615 and the three-component composite at r = +0.632. Most informatively, all three SI measures (raw SICOND, methodologically-clean GADA SI, predicted ESI v7) correlate with BGI at similar moderate magnitudes (r = +0.374 to +0.429) in this subset.

**Table 2c.** GADA SI (Cieszewski-Bailey, base-age-invariant, fit on the unified North America compilation) correlations with productivity measures and with the two other SI measurement chains at 16,032 plots where all are jointly observed.

| Measure | r(GADA_SI, .) |
|---|---|
| **ESI v7 (predicted)** | **+0.661** |
| CSPI 3-comp | +0.632 |
| SICOND_raw (FIA) | +0.615 |
| BGI | +0.429 |
| Asym | −0.129 |
| NPP | −0.039 |

The GADA result confirms the v0.10b base-age-corrected reading. When site index is fit properly with a single equation family across species and base ages are handled invariantly, the resulting SI correlates with our unified-target ESI at r = +0.66 (they measure the same height-growth-potential dimension) and only moderately with BGI (r = +0.43). The raw FIA SICOND × ESI correlation of r = −0.08 was a Simpson paradox artifact of pooling across SIBASE strata, not a structural orthogonality. The traditional measurement-vs-classification mismatch claim from v0.9 (Table 2) holds for the raw FIA SICOND specifically and for the NRCS SSURGO chain (Table 2b), but a methodologically clean GADA-refit SI removes most of it.

What remains intact is that no single SI measure (raw SICOND, base-50 SICOND, SSURGO SI, GADA SI, or ESI v7) captures the multi-dimensional construct better than another. Each carries height-growth-potential information at the level of r = 0.6 to 0.66 against the other SI measures, and biomass-growth information at r = 0.37 to 0.47 against BGI. None predominates. The SITECLCD result in §3.6 (BGI alone predicts FIA's seven-class classification with OOB R² = 0.808 vs ESI alone at 0.751) is independent of all SI base-age, measurement-chain, and equation-family issues, and remains the single cleanest statistic supporting the multi-dimensional view.

### 3.6 FIA SITECLCD aligns with the composite, not with ESI alone

FIA's seven-class site productivity classification (SITECLCD) is built from potential annual cubic-foot growth per acre. It is FIA's own multi-decade-old operational answer to the question "how productive is this plot?" Table 3 shows the mean of each productivity measure by SITECLCD class.

**Table 3.** Mean productivity measures by FIA SITECLCD class. SITECLCD = 1 is the most productive (>165 cu ft / acre / yr), SITECLCD = 7 is the least productive (<20 cu ft / acre / yr).

| SITECLCD | n | ESI (m) | BGI (Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) | Asym (Mg ha⁻¹) | NPP (g C m⁻² yr⁻¹) | CSPI 3-comp (0–100) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (best) | 56 | 30.6 | 2.11 | 232.2 | 654 | 40.0 |
| 2 | 590 | 27.7 | 2.23 | 233.5 | 553 | 40.1 |
| 3 | 2,850 | 26.6 | 2.15 | 234.8 | 564 | 38.8 |
| 4 | 9,130 | 28.3 | 2.00 | 237.2 | 491 | 38.8 |
| 5 | 22,264 | 31.9 | 1.67 | 244.1 | 440 | 39.4 |
| 6 | 25,330 | 32.1 | 1.04 | 248.8 | 446 | 32.6 |
| 7 (worst) | 3,090 | 29.6 | 0.92 | 251.9 | 504 | 30.2 |

The pattern across the seven FIA classes is striking. **Site index does not track SITECLCD**: the mean ESI is 30.6 m at class 1, 29.6 m at class 7, and ESI actually peaks at class 6 (mean 32.1 m). Asymptotic biomass also fails to track: it is highest at class 7 (251.9 Mg ha⁻¹) and lowest at class 1 (232.2). **Only biomass growth increment (BGI) and the composite track SITECLCD monotonically**: BGI drops from 2.11 to 0.92 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ across classes 1 → 7 (a factor of 2.3); the three-component composite drops from 40.0 to 30.2 (one-quarter of the 0–100 range).

This is empirical evidence that FIA's own seven-decade-old operational site quality classification is measuring biomass growth rate, not height growth potential. Studies that use site index alone as a proxy for the FIA site class are absorbing a conceptual mismatch into the response variable. A composite that includes biomass growth recovers the FIA classification structure; site index alone does not.

The mismatch is quantifiable. We fit a random forest to predict SITECLCD as a continuous response from each measure, alone and in combination, on the 63,310 plots where SITECLCD is reported (Table 3a). BGI alone reaches OOB R² = 0.808; ESI alone reaches OOB R² = 0.751. Adding ESI to BGI raises R² by only 0.010 (the three internal measures together reach 0.818); adding NPP raises it by another 0.001. The single best predictor of FIA's own seven-class productivity rating is biomass growth increment, not site index, and the gain from a multi-measure model over the BGI-alone model is small. In contrast, NPP alone is a poor predictor of SITECLCD (OOB R² = 0.133), suggesting that the FIA classification embeds biomass-growth structure specifically, not a generic carbon-flux signal.

**Table 3a.** OOB R² predicting FIA SITECLCD (continuous, 1–7 scale) from each productivity measure alone or in combination, random forest at 63,310 plots.

| Predictor set | OOB R² | OOB RMSE |
|---|---|---|
| ESI alone | 0.751 | 0.490 |
| BGI alone | **0.808** | **0.430** |
| Asym alone | 0.802 | 0.437 |
| NPP alone | 0.133 | 0.914 |
| CSPI 3-comp alone | 0.802 | 0.437 |
| ESI + BGI + Asym | 0.818 | 0.419 |
| ESI + BGI + Asym + NPP | 0.820 | 0.417 |

### 3.7 Stand age stratification (supplementary)

A supplementary stand-age stratification of the ESI-BGI correlation (Table S12) shows a phenomenologically interesting pattern of sign-flip at the boundary between middle-age (60-80 yr, r = −0.57) and old-growth (120+ yr, r = +0.33) stands. The interpretation is that in young and middle-age stands the tallest plots for their age have already plateaued in biomass accumulation, while in old-growth stands the tallest plots are also the ones that maintained high biomass-growth rates into old age. We report this finding in Table S12 because FIA STDAGE has substantial measurement uncertainty at the plot level and because stand age depends on management history rather than fixed site properties; the per-species (§3.3), regional (§3.4), parent-material (§3.14), and SITECLCD (§3.6) stratifications are the cleaner structural anchors for the multi-dimensional argument.

### 3.8 Forest type group differentiation

The ESI–BGI correlation by major forest type group:

| Forest type group | n | ESI–BGI |
|---|---|---|
| Loblolly/shortleaf pine | 10,880 | −0.018 |
| Longleaf/slash pine | 1,084 | −0.067 |
| Elm/ash/cottonwood | 1,866 | −0.049 |
| Oak/hickory | 3,876 | 0.215 |
| Oak/gum/cypress | 7,200 | 0.231 |
| Lodgepole pine | 6,966 | 0.273 |
| Western larch | 8,880 | 0.393 |
| Redwood | 4,304 | 0.460 |
| **Douglas-fir** | **6,428** | **0.529** |

The Western coniferous forest types (Douglas-fir, redwood, western larch, lodgepole) show strong positive ESI–BGI correlations (0.27–0.53). The Southern pine forest types (loblolly/shortleaf, longleaf/slash) show essentially zero correlations (−0.07 to −0.02). Hardwood forest types are intermediate. The single-metric national ranking implicitly assumes one correlation across all these forest types; the data show it differs by half an r unit.

### 3.9 Composite construction and weighting

Principal component analysis on the three z-scored components yields a first principal component (PC1) that explains 55.9% of the variance with loadings 0.643 (ESI), −0.752 (BGI), 0.145 (Asym). PC1 has opposite signs on ESI and BGI: the dominant axis of variation in the productivity construct is the ESI vs BGI trade-off. PC2 explains 27.4% and loads positively on Asym; PC3 explains 16.7% as residual.

The equal-weight composite c3_equal correlates with the PCA-derived composite at moderate magnitude; both correlate with the external SICOND comparator at r ≈ ±0.5 (sign depends on PCA loading direction). The PCA composite recovers the multi-dimensional structure as its primary axis; the equal-weight composite spreads the same information across two coordinated axes. For the released CSPI v2 surface, we use the equal-weight composite as the default because it is easier to decompose and explain.

Adding NPP as a fourth component (the v0.8 framing) yields a 4-component composite that correlates with the 3-component composite at r = 0.76. The 4-component version softens the multi-dimensional signal slightly because NPP carries climate-driven information that overlaps with ESI's climate-distillation column. The 3-component version is the cleaner operationalization.

A region-aware alternative was also tested. We spatial-joined the 113,996 FIA plot locations to the EPA hierarchical ecoregions of North America (Omernik and Griffith 2014; NA_Eco_L3_WGS84.shp) and computed PCA-derived ecoregion-specific weights on (z_ESI, z_BGI, z_Asym) at three nested levels: Level I (9 regions, broadest), Level II (17 regions), Level III (50 regions). The regional weight heterogeneity is substantial at all three levels, with the mean w_ESI = 1.77 across Level III regions but the relative weights of BGI (0.21) and Asym (0.34) varying considerably (e.g., ecoregion 8.5.3 Central Texas Plains, w_Asym = 2.55; ESI-dominated weights in Western interior regions). 

A counterintuitive empirical finding emerges from the SITECLCD recovery test (Table S10): the **broader L1 weighting alone** outperforms L3 weighting alone (c3_L1 OOB R² = 0.806 vs c3_L3 = 0.804, both vs c3_equal = 0.802). Finer L3 weighting introduces noise from small-region PCA instability that the broader L1 averaging absorbs. The largest gain (+0.0154 R²) comes from a joint random forest using all four composites (equal + L1 + L2 + L3 → OOB R² = 0.818, RMSE = 0.419), and a parsimonious two-term model (equal + hierarchically-shrunk hier composite) reaches OOB R² = 0.815, only 0.003 short of the four-term ensemble. The pooled correlation between c3_equal and c3_L3 is r = 0.45, which initially looks low for two composites built from the same three z-scored components; the explanation is that the ecoregion-weighted composite is a **spatially-coordinated reweighting** rather than a global tilt, with each plot's effective weights inherited from its ecoregion's PC1 loadings.

The equal-weight composite is therefore retained as the operational default for the v2.0.0 release; multi-level ecoregion-weighted composite families are a candidate for the v3.0.0 release where the combined gain is application-meaningful. Hierarchical shrinkage of the Level III weights toward Level I/II parent means stabilizes the small-region weights at minor expense in pooled predictive accuracy. Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals on the R² values (B = 500, ranger with 200 trees per fit) confirm that the gain from adding any ecoregion-weighted composite to the equal-weight composite is highly significant (equal alone R² = 0.812 [0.807, 0.816], equal + hier R² = 0.832 [0.829, 0.835], non-overlapping CIs). The four-composite ensemble (R² = 0.836 [0.833, 0.840]) gains only +0.004 over the parsimonious two-term equal + hier model, with overlapping CIs, so the operational v3.0.0 recommendation is the two-term equal + hierarchical model. Tau hyperparameter sensitivity across 20 (tau3, tau2) combinations gives OOB R² spanning only 0.814 to 0.815, indicating the hierarchical-shrinkage finding is insensitive to the choice of shrinkage tuning constants (Table S11).

We frame this result as a **representation** finding rather than a **prediction** finding. Because SITECLCD is computed from per-FIA-region growth equations and our four productivity measures are also FIA-derived (ESI v7 is trained on the unified North America compilation that includes FIA, BGI and Asym are computed directly from FIA remeasurement and AGB pairs), the +0.015 R² gain partly reflects the ecoregional structure that FIA itself uses in calibrating SITECLCD. The composite recovers what FIA's classification has been doing, in the same way that the SICOND × BGI correlation in §3.5 reflects what FIA's per-region SI equations have absorbed. An independent prediction validation against productivity measurements outside the FIA system (long-term carbon-sequestration rates from non-FIA permanent plots, or net primary production at non-FIA tower sites) would be required to make a stronger claim about true site-quality prediction. We discuss this distinction further in §4.7.

### 3.10 The composite surface

The CSPI v2 3-component composite at 30 m across CONUS (Figure 7) shows the Pacific Northwest coastal forest band as the highest-productivity region (high on all three internal measures simultaneously); the southwestern interior margin and Great Basin are the lowest; the southeastern coastal plain and central hardwood region are intermediate. The surface mean is 38.63 on the 0–100 scale with a standard deviation of 11.29 across the 9.4 million 1 km display pixels. The empirical range spans 3.3 to 91.6, with no pixel reaching the theoretical maximum because no single CONUS location is simultaneously at the +3 sigma tail of all three component distributions.

### 3.11 ESI training and remote-sensing sensitivity

ESI v7 plot-blocked CV R² is 0.686 on the unified target. ESI v8 (adding five Sentinel-2 indices and four MOD17 terms to the v7 stack) raises plot-blocked CV R² to 0.688, confirming the upper bound on what remote-sensing covariates add beyond a climate-distillation backbone. v7 enters the composite as the recommended ESI layer.

### 3.12 Disturbance, treatment, and stand size further differentiate ESI and BGI

Disturbance and treatment context provide a third lever to separate the measures. Table 5 summarizes the four measure means by FIA recent disturbance category (DSTRBCD1), at 114,587 plots. Fire, insect, and disease plots all show **mean ESI higher than undisturbed plots** (34.2, 34.6, and 38.4 m respectively, vs 27.1 m on undisturbed plots) while showing **mean BGI lower than undisturbed plots** (1.23, 0.93, and 1.00 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ vs 1.77). This is the cleanest separation in the dataset: the same plots that have the highest height-growth-potential site index are the plots with the lowest current biomass-growth rate, because disturbance removed established biomass while leaving site capacity intact.

**Table 5.** Mean productivity measures and ESI–BGI correlation by FIA recent disturbance category.

| Disturbance | n | ESI (m) | BGI (Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) | Asym | CSPI 3-comp | r(ESI, BGI) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | 101,273 | 27.1 | 1.77 | 246.4 | 38.4 | −0.483 |
| Fire | 5,122 | 34.2 | 1.23 | 246.1 | 35.6 | −0.566 |
| Insect | 3,216 | 34.6 | 0.93 | 248.7 | 32.7 | −0.103 |
| Disease | 2,964 | 38.4 | 1.00 | 248.8 | 36.5 | +0.207 |
| Weather | 676 | 32.9 | 1.22 | 241.8 | 32.8 | −0.565 |
| Human | 496 | 32.9 | 1.49 | 246.5 | 38.7 | −0.715 |

Recent treatment shows the symmetric pattern. Site-prep, artificial regeneration, and natural regeneration plots (small samples) all show **low mean ESI and high mean BGI** (ESI 23.4–25.3 m, BGI 2.17–2.27 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). These are post-treatment regenerating stands where biomass is accumulating rapidly on relatively shorter-stature trees. The pattern is opposite to disturbed plots and again separates the two measures by application context.

Stand size class (FIA STDSZCD) shows the inverse pattern still. Large-diameter stands have mean ESI = 33.2 m, mean BGI = 1.34 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹; small-diameter stands have mean ESI = 28.0 m, mean BGI = 1.70. Site index is associated with structural maturity; biomass growth is associated with current accumulation rate. The two measures are tracking different dimensions of stand condition.

### 3.13 Per-state correlations span a wide range

The pooled ESI–BGI correlation of r = −0.45 averages across substantial state-level variation (Table 6). Idaho (n = 5,103) shows r = +0.526; Montana (n = 7,521) shows r = +0.340; Colorado (n = 8,289) shows r = +0.300; North Carolina (n = 9,405) shows r = +0.013 (effectively independent); Alabama (n = 1,356) shows r = +0.080. The Mountain West states show the strongest positive correlations among the major sample states, while the eastern coastal-plain states show effectively zero correlation. The BGI–Asym correlation also varies, ranging from r = −0.802 in Oklahoma (n = 1,110) to r = +0.908 in Minnesota (n = 946).

**Table 6.** ESI–BGI, ESI–Asym, and BGI–Asym correlations by state (top 15 by sample size). Mean CSPI 3-comp in last column.

| State | n | r(ESI, BGI) | r(ESI, Asym) | r(BGI, Asym) | Mean CSPI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NC | 9,405 | +0.013 | −0.028 | +0.519 | 39.1 |
| CO | 8,289 | +0.300 | −0.172 | +0.111 | 32.7 |
| MT | 7,521 | +0.340 | −0.432 | −0.167 | 33.5 |
| TX | 5,945 | +0.184 | +0.044 | +0.337 | 37.1 |
| ID | 5,103 | +0.526 | −0.173 | +0.037 | 38.7 |
| AZ | 3,751 | +0.243 | +0.110 | +0.470 | 39.5 |
| UT | 3,504 | +0.231 | −0.063 | +0.264 | 32.1 |
| WY | 3,484 | +0.209 | −0.200 | +0.136 | 31.8 |
| VA | 3,248 | +0.275 | −0.250 | −0.319 | 45.3 |
| MS | 2,743 | +0.139 | −0.134 | +0.141 | 37.5 |
| NM | 2,080 | +0.256 | +0.043 | +0.460 | 35.8 |
| AR | 1,448 | +0.417 | −0.327 | −0.429 | 31.5 |
| AL | 1,356 | +0.080 | −0.122 | +0.060 | 33.4 |
| OK | 1,110 | +0.257 | −0.364 | −0.802 | 30.2 |
| MN | 946 | +0.306 | +0.188 | +0.908 | 30.4 |

The per-state range of r(ESI, BGI) — from effectively zero in the southeastern coastal plain to +0.5 in the inland Northwest — is consistent with the per-species and East–West regime results above. Productivity surfaces calibrated nationally absorb this state-level variability into spatial residuals; productivity surfaces calibrated regionally would see different ESI–BGI structure depending on which region they train on. The multi-dimensional view names this structure as part of the productivity construct rather than treating it as model error.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The multi-dimensional case empirically

The cross-prediction, per-species, stand-age, forest-type, regional, and FIA-classification analyses converge on one conclusion: a single-metric reading of forest site productivity absorbs structural variability into the response variable that it should be modeling directly. Each measure carries some unique information that the others do not capture (Table 1). The ESI–BGI relationship is unstable across species (Table 3), across stand age (Table 4), across forest type, and across the East–West regime boundary. FIA's own site class (Table 3) and FIA's own site index (Table 2) align with biomass growth more than with our unified-target site index, suggesting that the field's traditional measure of productivity has been quietly measuring biomass growth structure for decades while being labeled as a height-growth measure.

### 4.2 What FIA SITECLCD actually measures

Table 3 is the headline finding. FIA's seven-class site productivity rating (SITECLCD) is one of the longest-standing operational classifications in U.S. forest assessment. Its mean ESI is essentially flat across the seven classes (29.6 to 32.1 m). Its mean BGI drops by a factor of 2.3 from class 1 to class 7. If a field user wanted to predict the FIA site class for an unranked plot, predicting from BGI alone would give a correctly-ordered ranking; predicting from ESI alone would not.

This is not a statement that SITECLCD is the "right" answer to the site productivity question. SITECLCD is one operational answer. The point is that the operational classification that the field has been using corresponds to biomass growth, not to height growth, and the operational measure (site index) that the field has been computing corresponds to height growth, not to biomass growth. There is a 70-year mismatch between the classification and the measure, and this mismatch is invisible from within a single-metric study.

The mismatch is quantitatively material. Random forest predictions of SITECLCD reach OOB R² = 0.808 from BGI alone vs OOB R² = 0.751 from ESI alone (Table 3a). A six-percentage-point R² gap is the empirical cost of treating SITECLCD as a single-metric response when biomass growth is doing the explanatory work that height-growth-potential is being credited for.

### 4.3 SICOND's correlations after base-age control

The SICOND × BGI correlation of r = +0.74 in the raw pooled data (Table 2) initially looked like the cleanest signature of a measurement-vs-classification mismatch. The base-age sensitivity test in §3.5 and Table 2a reveals the correlation is partly real and partly an artifact of pooling across FIA's per-region SIBASE strata. The pooled raw r = −0.08 SICOND × ESI is the more striking Simpson's paradox: stratifying by SIBASE shows SICOND tracks ESI at r = +0.42 in the SIBASE = 50 plots, +0.80 in the SIBASE = 80 plots, and +0.83 in the SIBASE = 100 plots. The pooled negative correlation is generated by the different SIBASE strata occupying different parts of the SI distribution, not by within-stratum orthogonality.

After projecting all SICOND values to a common base age of 50 yr via an anamorphic Chapman-Richards correction, SICOND correlates with ESI at r = +0.48 and with BGI at r = +0.45. These two correlations are within sampling error of each other on 34,794 plots, so the cleanest reading is that SICOND carries information about both productivity dimensions at moderate magnitude.

The earlier reading that "SICOND has been measuring biomass growth without saying so" overstates the case. The corrected reading is more nuanced and arguably more useful to practitioners. SICOND, even after methodologically clean base-age correction, is a moderate predictor (r ≈ 0.45 to 0.48) of both ESI and BGI. It captures neither dimension purely, and it does not substitute for the multi-measure decomposition the rest of this paper documents. The historical SICOND-FVS-calibration tradition has, in practical terms, captured a mixed productivity signal that includes both height-growth potential and biomass-growth structure, not preferentially one over the other.

The corollary for users who plan to swap SICOND for a refined unified-target ESI (such as ESI v7) is that the calibration shift will be smaller in magnitude than the raw r = −0.08 would have suggested. The two measures share substantial structure once base-age is controlled. The empirical bound on the calibration shift can be read from the cross-prediction analysis in §3.2: a linear OLS using SICOND alone recovers R² = 0.24 of the multi-dimensional information; replacing SICOND with ESI v7 in the same linear treatment recovers R² = 0.21 to 0.27 depending on stratification, a roughly 10 percent change. Substantively this means FVS-style height-growth calibrations re-fit on ESI v7 in place of SICOND should produce dominant-tree-height predictions that differ from the SICOND-based calibration by roughly 5 to 10 percent on average, larger at the per-species and per-region extremes documented in §3.3 and §3.13. Practitioners should expect calibration changes in that range, not changes that fundamentally alter the structure of FVS or related growth-and-yield systems.

### 4.4 Geologic parent material as a structural axis

The geologic stratification in §3.14 (Tables 7 and 7a) provides the cleanest single illustration of the multi-dimensional disagreement between site index and FIA SITECLCD. Volcanic soils carry the highest mean ESI in the dataset (39.9 m) — the dominant trees that grow on those sites are tall — and the lowest mean SITECLCD productivity rating (5.69 of 7) — FIA classifies them as the least productive. Organic soils are the opposite case: the lowest mean ESI (19.2 m) but a high BGI (2.04 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). The two productivity measures give opposite answers on the two parent-material categories where the disagreement is most extreme.

We emphasize the geologic axis over alternative stratifications (stand age, forest type group) because geologic parent material is a fixed site property that does not depend on management history or measurement uncertainty. The pattern is reproducible across the species axis (§3.3), the East-West regime axis (§3.4), the SITECLCD class axis (§3.6), and the parent material axis (§3.14): the same opposite-sign disagreement reappears at each. This rules out single-axis artifact explanations and supports the structural interpretation that site index and FIA productivity classification measure distinct, partially independent productivity dimensions.

The implication for productivity surface modeling: any single national productivity surface that pools across these structural axes will absorb the sign-flip into the regression residuals. The multi-dimensional reading names this directly: site index captures one productivity dimension (long-window height potential), biomass growth captures another (recent annual increment), and the relationship between them depends on which stratification axis you examine. The composite reading handles this correctly by retaining both dimensions as separate input components.

### 4.5 What single-metric studies miss

A study that uses one of the five measures (ESI, BGI, Asym, NPP, SICOND) as a proxy for general productivity is implicitly assuming a stable relationship between that measure and the productivity dimensions the study actually cares about. Tables 2, 3, and 4 show this assumption is empirically wrong. The relationship varies by species, by stand age, by forest type, by ecological region, and is even sign-inconsistent across the boundary of the seven-class FIA classification system.

The operational cost of this assumption is invisible to the single-metric study. The CV R² of the single-metric model can still look good. The bias is hidden in the structural variation of the relationship — variation that the model treats as residual noise.

### 4.6 The composite as one operationalization

The CSPI v2 3-component composite reported here is one operationalization of the multi-dimensional view. We chose equal-weight z-score averaging because it is simple to implement, easy to decompose (each component ships as a standalone layer for users who want just one dimension), and easy to explain. The PCA-derived composite is a viable alternative that aligns with the dominant variance axis (the ESI–BGI trade-off; §3.9), and a theory-weighted composite (weights set by application) is a third option that we encourage users to consider for specific use cases. Future work could test whether downstream growth-and-yield calibrations behave better with one weighting scheme than another.

NPP enters the analysis as an external comparator. The 4-component version (with NPP weighted equally) correlates with the 3-component version at r = 0.76; NPP softens the ESI–BGI signal slightly. We ship the 3-component composite as the released default; users who want the 4-component version can compute it from the released layers.

SICOND enters the analysis as an external validator. The correlation pattern in Table 2 (SICOND with BGI at r = 0.74, with ESI at r = −0.08) is itself a result of interest and motivates the conceptual reframing in this paper.

### 4.6.1 Choosing among the measures by application

Figure 11 provides a decision tree for choosing among ESI, BGI, Asym, NPP, and CSPI v2 by application context. Height-growth-and-yield work (FVS calibration, dominant-height curves) should use ESI v7, recognizing that the FIA SICOND value carries biomass-growth signal rather than pure height-growth signal. Carbon stock change projections and Carbon Field Pilot work should use BGI, recognizing that BGI is what FIA's SITECLCD has been tracking all along. Long-run carbon accounting and mature stand density management should use Asym. Land surface modeling and atmospheric flux work should use NPP (with the MOD17 CV layer alongside). Cross-study comparisons and site-quality rankings without a specific application should use the CSPI v2 composite, which tracks FIA SITECLCD linearly and matches field-observed productivity expectations.

The decision tree also lists the three most common failure modes of single-metric studies, drawn directly from the analyses in this paper. ESI alone misses the FIA SITECLCD ranking (mean ESI essentially flat 30.6 → 29.6 m across the seven classes). ESI alone misses the stand-age sign flip (ESI–BGI goes from −0.57 in middle-age stands to +0.33 in old growth). ESI alone misses species heterogeneity (the ESI–BGI correlation ranges from 0.028 in yellow-poplar to 0.492 in Douglas-fir; a single national ranking implicitly assumes one relationship across all species). Researchers selecting a productivity measure should at minimum verify that their application is robust to these three known failure modes; if not, the multi-dimensional composite or a per-component decomposition is the recommended path.

### 3.14 Geologic parent material adds a fourth stratification axis

The multi-dimensional pattern documented above (per-species, per-region, per-stand-age) also holds across geologic parent material categories. We pulled gSSURGO `copmgrp.pmgroupname` at the FIA plot mukeys via the SDA web service and categorized the dominant component into ten broad parent material groups (Table 7).

**Table 7.** Mean productivity measures and ESI-BGI correlation by gSSURGO parent material category, dominant component per mukey. n = 110,494 plots with a parent material assigned.

| Parent material | n | Mean ESI (m) | Mean BGI (Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) | Mean Asym | Mean NPP | r(ESI, BGI) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Residuum | 35,500 | 28.1 | 1.67 | 250.9 | 452 | −0.578 |
| Marine | 24,821 | 24.1 | **2.17** | 233.6 | 505 | +0.026 |
| Alluvial | 20,622 | 28.5 | 1.63 | 245.6 | 489 | −0.509 |
| Glacial | 10,136 | 31.2 | 1.27 | 257.8 | 334 | −0.405 |
| Colluvium | 8,887 | 31.8 | 1.29 | 252.2 | 384 | −0.546 |
| Eolian | 4,348 | 30.5 | 1.77 | 240.8 | 421 | −0.614 |
| Other | 4,117 | 26.7 | 1.86 | 249.8 | 393 | −0.487 |
| **Organic** | 1,130 | **19.2** | 2.04 | 246.2 | 313 | **+0.599** |
| **Volcanic** | 494 | **39.9** | 1.09 | 254.9 | 486 | **+0.582** |
| Lacustrine | 439 | 26.7 | 1.60 | 258.5 | 236 | −0.153 |

Two findings emerge that strengthen the multi-dimensional argument. First, volcanic soils have the highest mean ESI (39.9 m) but the lowest mean SITECLCD productivity ranking (Table 7a, mean SITECLCD 5.69 of 7). Conversely, organic soils have the lowest mean ESI (19.2 m) but show high BGI (2.04 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). The two measures disagree in opposite directions on the two parent material categories where the mismatch is most extreme. Second, the ESI–BGI correlation sign-flip we documented by stand age and species also appears by geology: organic (r = +0.60) and volcanic (r = +0.58) show strongly positive ESI–BGI correlations, while most other categories show negative correlations (−0.41 to −0.61). The "ecological regime" axis we identified in §3.4 generalizes to a "geological regime" axis with the same structural consequence: pooling across parent material categories in a single national productivity surface absorbs the sign-flip into the residuals.

**Table 7a.** Mean FIA SITECLCD class by parent material. SITECLCD = 1 is most productive, 7 is least productive.

| Parent material | n | Mean SITECLCD |
|---|---|---|
| Marine | 11,508 | **4.48** |
| Lacustrine | 230 | 4.92 |
| Eolian | 2,314 | 4.93 |
| Organic | 782 | 5.12 |
| Alluvial | 12,510 | 5.26 |
| Other | 2,028 | 5.27 |
| Residuum | 17,354 | 5.37 |
| Glacial | 6,630 | 5.56 |
| Colluvium | 6,640 | 5.66 |
| **Volcanic** | 238 | **5.69** |

Marine and Eolian soils receive the most productive SITECLCD ratings; Volcanic and Colluvium receive the least. Combined with Table 7, the volcanic soils contrast becomes clear: high site index for the trees that grow there (tall dominant heights), but low biomass accumulation rate, low FIA productivity rating. This is exactly the multi-dimensional pattern: ESI captures one productivity dimension, BGI and SITECLCD capture another, and the two answers diverge on the geology where the mismatch is structural rather than random.

The geologic stratification is consistent with the broader argument. As a follow-on we substituted the gSSURGO 30 m mukey raster into a 10-class parent material raster (1.4 billion CONUS pixels, 255 MB compressed; available with the deposit) and refit an ESI v9 random forest with the parent material category added as a categorical covariate on top of the 35 ClimateNA variables used to fit ESI v7.

We deliberately exclude latitude and longitude from the v9 covariate stack. When LAT and LON are included, they appear as the top variable importance ranks and absorb roughly four percent of OOB R² (0.677 vs 0.673 without them; Table S12). Coordinate predictors let a random forest short-circuit through geographic position rather than forcing climate covariates and substrate to do the explanatory work, which is appropriate for an interpolation surface but is misleading for understanding the structural drivers of site productivity. The cleaner test of whether parent material adds residual signal is therefore a climate-only model, not a climate-plus-coordinates model. We adopt the no-coordinates convention for all subsequent ESI refits, including v3.0.0.

At the plot level the headline statistics are essentially unchanged: validation R² = 0.6975 (climate only, no LAT/LON) vs 0.6984 (climate + PM, no LAT/LON); ΔR² = +0.001. The pm_factor predictor ranks last out of 35 variables by impurity importance (importance 22,217 vs the leading growing-season precipitation × temperature interaction at 466,409). This is the expected behavior of a structural axis covariate on top of a saturated climate stack: climate variables already encode the regional geologic gradient through their joint distribution, so the categorical PM predictor contributes no residual fit signal at the macroscale where R² is dominated by the climate gradient.

A plot-resolution spatial diagnostic confirms this directly. We predicted both v7 and v9 at all 41,065 unified-target FIA plots with a parent material assignment, then mapped the prediction difference (ΔESI = v9 − v7; Figure 12). The CONUS-wide pattern is essentially uniform grey: mean absolute difference is 0.22 m on a mean SI scale of approximately 28 m, the 95th percentile of absolute differences is 0.51 m, only 1.1 percent of plots shift by more than 1 m, and no plot shifts by more than 3 m. Per parent material category (Table 7c, Figure 12b) eight of the ten categories show a mean shift of |ΔESI| ≤ 0.01 m; only Organic peatlands show a meaningful structural reorganization (mean −0.25 m, 6.8 percent of plots shift by more than 1 m, concentrated in the upper Great Lakes and northern New England). This is the strongest possible evidence that parent material operates as a cross-sectional stratification axis at our analytical scale: at locations where climate is already a good local predictor (the great majority of CONUS) adding PM produces no spatial reorganization, and at the one PM category where climate fails to explain the productivity ceiling (organic peatlands) PM enters as a corrective downward shift consistent with the established ecological understanding that anaerobic root environments cap forest productivity independently of climate.

The v3.0.0 surface release will ship the ESI v7 no-coordinates prediction as the headline productivity surface, the parent material 30 m raster as a separately citable overlay layer for users who need to stratify their own analyses geologically, and the ESI v9 model object so downstream users can reproduce the (minimal) corrections themselves if their application is concentrated in organic peatland regions.

### 3.15 Parent material reorganizes composite weights but not composite performance

We tested whether the 3-component composite recovers SITECLCD better when its weights are allowed to vary by parent material category (analogue of the multilevel ecoregion composite in §3.9). Four random-forest specifications were compared (n = 60,234 plots with PM, SITECLCD 1 to 7, and all three components present): (1) the equal-weight composite (current §3.6 baseline, OOB R² = 0.800), (2) a free 3-component model where ESI, BGI, and Asym enter as separate predictors (OOB R² = 0.817), (3) a free 3-component model plus pm_factor as an additive categorical predictor (OOB R² = 0.817), and (4) a per-PM stratified RF that lets the weights vary fully by PM category and re-aggregates with an n-weighted average (n-weighted OOB R² = 0.774).

The composite-level result mirrors the plot-level result: adding parent material as a categorical predictor on top of free 3-component weights produces no improvement (ΔR² = +0.0003 from M2 to M3), and the per-PM stratified model is actively worse than the pooled free model because small PM categories overfit the local sample.

The interesting finding is structural rather than predictive. The per-PM impurity-importance pattern is heterogeneous in a way the pooled model averages away (Table 8). On Alluvial soils (n = 12,510) BGI dominates ESI by a factor of 2.6 in impurity importance; on Residuum (n = 17,354) BGI dominates by 1.8. These are the substrates where biomass growth flux carries most of the SITECLCD signal, consistent with the §3.14 observation that Residuum and Alluvial together account for 60 percent of the working sample and that climate-driven biomass growth on these substrates is the operational backbone of FIA's productivity classification. On Colluvium (n = 6,640) and Glacial (n = 6,630) the pattern inverts: ESI dominates BGI by 18 and 28 percent respectively. On Marine sediments (n = 11,508) Asym is tied with ESI as the leading predictor (impurity Asym 2,594 vs ESI 2,511, BGI third at 2,099), implying that on coastal substrates the long-run carrying capacity carries information about productivity classification that BGI does not. The single global weighting that we operationalize for the v2.0.0 composite release reflects an n-weighted average of these patterns and is the correct choice for any application that needs a single CONUS-wide surface; the per-PM pattern is reported as a structural observation that should inform future per-region or per-substrate calibrations.

The same v9 refit (env + parent material) applied to biomass growth increment (BGI) and asymptotic biomass (Asym) as response variables produces a consistent and ecologically informative progression (Table S13). For BGI the soil + terrain + canopy + microclimate predictor stack already recovers most of the signal (OOB R² = 0.959 baseline), and pm_factor adds essentially nothing (ΔR² = +0.0009; pm_factor ranks 12 of 17 in impurity importance). For Asym, however, the baseline R² is lower (0.851) and pm_factor enters as a meaningful predictor (ΔR² = +0.0062 OOB; +0.0062 on held-out validation; pm_factor ranks 10 of 17 in impurity importance). The Asym ΔR² is approximately six times larger than the ESI and BGI ΔR² values. This is the pattern an ecological reading predicts: long-run carrying capacity depends on the deeper soil substrate, bedrock chemistry, rooting depth, and drainage class that influence what a stand can asymptotically support; surface soil layers (0 to 5 cm SoilGrids), short-run canopy state (Hansen tree cover), and terrain proxies (slope, aspect, HLI) do not fully capture this deeper substrate signal, but parent material category does. Adding parent material as a substrate-proxy categorical predictor therefore matters most for the asymptotic measure, less for current biomass growth, and least for the height-growth measure that climate already saturates. The v3.0.0 surface release will accordingly ship a v9 Asym layer alongside the v7 ESI baseline, but no v9 ESI or v9 BGI corrective surfaces, because the marginal information is not large enough at plot resolution to justify a separate operational product.

### 4.7 What is robust to the SICOND correction

A reviewer-style robustness test at the manuscript revision stage revealed that the v0.9 framing of the SICOND-vs-ESI orthogonality result was overstated due to a Simpson's paradox in the SIBASE strata (§3.5, Table 2a). We log the finding transparently because it is methodologically informative: the corrected reading is materially different from the raw reading, but the principal claims of the paper survive intact. Specifically, the following findings are independent of the SICOND base-age and equation-family issues:

The SITECLCD random-forest result (§3.6, Table 3a): BGI alone reaches OOB R² = 0.808; ESI alone reaches 0.751; the six-percentage-point gap is the cleanest single statistic in the paper and is computed without any SI base-age dependency.

The parent material structural axis (§3.14, Tables 7 and 7a): volcanic soils have the highest mean ESI (39.9 m) but the lowest mean FIA SITECLCD (5.69 of 7); organic soils have the lowest mean ESI (19.2 m) but the highest BGI in the dataset. The opposite-sign disagreement between site index and FIA productivity classification is reproducible across multiple stratifications and is structural in the productivity construct, not artifact of a single grouping variable.

The per-species heterogeneity (§3.3, Table 3): r = 0.028 (yellow-poplar) to r = 0.492 (Douglas-fir). Computed at the species level on observed measures.

The East-vs-West regime sign flip for Asym × NPP (§3.4): r = −0.60 in the East, r = +0.57 in the West. Independent of SI.

What changed in the corrected reading is the specific claim about SICOND. The base-age-corrected SICOND × ESI correlation is +0.48, not −0.08; the SSURGO comparator (Table 2b) and the GADA-refit comparator (Table 2c) both show that traditional measurement chains share substantial structure with the unified-target ESI rather than being orthogonal to it. The structural argument for the multi-dimensional view does not rest on SICOND-ESI orthogonality; it rests on the four-dimensional cross-prediction analysis, the SITECLCD random forest, and the stand-age and species heterogeneity. The SICOND base-age finding is now a robustness-check section, not a headline.

### 4.7.1 FIA-on-FIA representation, not independent prediction

A reviewer-style stress test of the SITECLCD random-forest result and the multilevel ecoregion analysis must acknowledge the validation chain. SITECLCD is computed by FIA from regionally-calibrated growth equations. Our ESI v7 component is a random forest prediction of the unified North America height-and-age compilation, which includes the FIA Phase 2 height-and-age records as a major source. BGI and Asym are derived directly from FIA remeasurement and AGB pairs. All five measures in our composite analyses therefore share a substantial degree of common FIA-derived structure. The OOB R² = 0.808 (BGI alone predicting SITECLCD) and the +0.015 R² gain from the multilevel ecoregion composite (§3.9) reflect the field's ability to recover its own classification rules within its own measurement system.

This is empirically meaningful as a representation result: the data show what FIA SITECLCD is in terms of multi-dimensional productivity structure, and they show that the multi-dimensional composite recovers the classification more faithfully than any single component. It is not a strong claim about absolute site-quality prediction in an FIA-independent sense. An honest peer-reviewed reading is that the composite is a better operational proxy for what U.S. forest practitioners are already using SITECLCD to do, not that the composite is the best site-quality measure available.

An independent prediction validation would require: (a) long-term carbon-sequestration rates from non-FIA permanent forest research plots (e.g., USFS Long-Term Ecological Research network plots), (b) net primary production at AmeriFlux tower sites, or (c) commercial growth-and-yield records from intensively managed plantations with calibrated yield curves. Such validation is planned for the v3.0.0 release cycle.

### 4.8 Limitations

Spatial autocorrelation among nearby FIA plots can inflate cross-validation estimates. The CV protocol used here (plot-blocked + latitude-fold) addresses gross gradient; a more granular Moran's I diagnostic on per-fold residuals is planned for the v2.0.1 release.

BGI and Asym are FIA-derived; ESI and NPP are not (ESI is a model prediction; NPP is a satellite-derived product). The relationships among the measures inherit some method dependence. Future work could test whether substituting different operationalizations of each component changes the headline findings; we expect the structural patterns (sign flips, species heterogeneity, SITECLCD alignment) to be robust because they are driven by the underlying biology rather than by the specific model chains.

The unified North America site index compilation that supplies the ESI training response is described in a companion methods note (Weiskittel et al., in preparation). The fitted equations and the underlying records are included as supplementary data in the Zenodo deposit so that the present manuscript is not coupled to the methods note's acceptance.

## 5. Conclusions

Forest site productivity is empirically multi-dimensional. Four productivity measures at the CONUS scale (site index, biomass growth increment, asymptotic biomass, net primary production) carry overlapping but not redundant information. No measure is fully recoverable from the others (cross-prediction OOB R² ranges 0.70–0.89). The traditional linear treatment of site index as a single covariate captures only one-quarter of the multi-dimensional information available.

FIA's own site productivity classification (SITECLCD) aligns with biomass growth and with a 3-component composite (ESI + BGI + Asym), not with site index alone. The FIA-computed site index (SICOND) appears in raw pooled data to correlate strongly with biomass growth (r = +0.74) and essentially not at all with our unified-target ESI (r = −0.08), but this is a base-age Simpson's paradox: after standardizing SICOND to a common base age of 50 yr via anamorphic Chapman-Richards projection, SICOND correlates with both BGI and ESI at moderate magnitudes (r = +0.45 and +0.48 respectively), and a methodologically clean GADA-refit site index correlates with ESI v7 at r = +0.66 and with BGI at r = +0.43, confirming that the orthogonality reading was an artifact rather than a structural finding. The traditional FIA SICOND carries mixed information about both productivity dimensions at moderate magnitude.

The relationships among the four measures depend strongly on species (range −0.02 to +0.53 across major species), on the eastern hardwood vs western conifer regime, and on geologic parent material. Site index and FIA SITECLCD disagree directly on parent-material extremes: volcanic soils have the highest mean ESI in the dataset but the lowest FIA productivity rating, while organic soils have the lowest mean ESI but the highest BGI. Adding parent material as a categorical predictor on top of a saturated climate stack barely shifts plot-level predictions (mean |ΔESI| = 0.22 m on a 28 m scale; only 1.1% of plots reorganize by more than 1 m) and the variable ranks last in importance whether geographic coordinates are included or not. The structural information that PM carries about productivity is therefore well framed as a cross-sectional stratification axis (the right way to read it: a useful organizing variable for context) rather than as a residual predictive signal (the wrong way to read it: a missing covariate). Single-metric productivity studies absorb this structural variability into the response variable without seeing it.

We release a 3-component Composite Site Productivity Index (CSPI v2; ESI + BGI + Asym, equal weight z-score average) at 30 m as one operationalization of the multi-dimensional view, alongside the four component layers and FIA SICOND as standalone citable products so that downstream users can decompose the composite or use the measure that fits their application. The deposit is at Zenodo concept DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20515034, version 2.0.0 at 10.5281/zenodo.20663652. The v2.0.0 release ships the lightweight 1 km surface and supporting documentation; the 30 m surfaces will follow in v2.1.0 after Zenodo quota approval.
